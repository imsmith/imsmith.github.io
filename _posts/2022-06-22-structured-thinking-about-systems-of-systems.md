# Structured thinking about systems of systems technologies

## Activites

+ data processing
+ telecommunication
+ durable storage
+ defense

### Busses for communications

+ PCIe - very low latency electrical communication
+ Ethernet - relatively local device to device communication
+ HTTP - global communication

### Things that are telecommunicated

+ documents - relatively static expressions composed of objects and data
+ objects - facts represented in a machine readable format
+ data - objects in relationships to other objects

## Concerns

### Social concerns  

Social concerns are external to the system but universal to humans
+ trust
+ privacy
+ anonymity
+ ownership
+ identity

### Concrete concerns 
Concrete concerns are internal mechanisms of importance to operational activities
+ reliability
+ interoperability
+ availability
  + fault tolerance
  + high availability
+ scalability
+ resiliency
+ durability
+ discoverability
+ observability

### Systemic concerns
Systemic concerns are internal activities that govern the interactions of parts of the system
+ scheduling
+ disaggregation
+ integrity
+ anti-fragility

## Forms

### Structural forms 
Structural forms are universal or ideal forms of how to structure activities
+ castles
+ monuments
+ slabs
+ homesteads
+ corals
+ malls
+ habitats

### Bio-behavioral forms 
Behaviors of organic species that can be mimiced in our systems
+ ants
+ bees
+ rats
+ octopus
+ slime mold
+ virus
+ lichen

### Topological forms 
Forms of communication networks
+ peer-to-peer
+ client-server
+ grid
+ mainframe
+ centralized
+ decentralized
+ distributed
+ tethered
+ transient
+ mobility

## Other concepts

### Models
+ linked-data
+ immutable data
+ pattern language
+ digital twins
+ data models
+ information models
+ ontologies
+ taxonomies

### Data structures
+ Merkel tree / DAG
+ evolving / adaptation
+ serverless functions

### Algorithms
+ PageRank
+ Bayes' Theorem
+ Dyjkstra's algorithm
+ k-means

### Human behavioral forms
+ tribalism
+ mercantilism
+ capitalism
+ socialism
+ -punk

### Socio-philosophical forms
+ sovereign data
+ permaculture
+ studio / atelier
+ intertwingularity
+ atemporality
+ moneyball
