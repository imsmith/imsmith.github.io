# The three legged stool of leadership

![[2022-09-27-the-three-legged-stool-of-leadership.svg]]

You cannot expect someone to be responsible to accomplish a task if they do not have the authority to do it and keep others from saboutaging their efforts.

You cannot have authority without commensurable accountability.  The iconic call to action from Spider-Man, "With great power comes great responsibility" is a statement on accountability, not responsibility.  With great power comes great responsibility _because there is great accountability measuring what you do with your power_.  Submission to an authority which holds your power to account is the prerequiste to leadership.

Authority is never absolute.  It flows from either consent or coercion.  Coercive authority is authority obtained by force and maintained through fear.  Concentual authority is authority that emerges from a group and is maintained through trust.

The barometer of leadership, and of leaders, is to ask followers about the balance of fear and trust they have in the leaders; "Do you trust your leader to do what is best for you?"; "Are you afraid of your leader?".
