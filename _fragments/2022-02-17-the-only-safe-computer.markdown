# The only safe computer

The only safe computer is a computer that has no electricity.  The rest of the time you are just counting on probability to be on your side, which is an inherently horrible strategy to manage risk because it conveys the illusion of safety while also affording zero agency in that safety.   E.g.: We probably won't be hit by an extinction level asteroid, so that feels safe, but if there is an extinction level asteroid on its way, there is nothing we can do about it, so we have no agency.  ==> You probably won't have your brain locked by ransom ware, but if you do there is nothing you can do about it.
