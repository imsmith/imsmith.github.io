# Why we can't have nice things

Network layer security isn't used
Therefore network layer prioritization isn't used
Therefore the Internet isn't end-to-end
Therefore middleboxes break the Internet into (at least) a topology that is: access edge <--middlebox--> core <--middlebox--> delivery edge
Therefore the middleboxes are too stateful
Therefore the middleboxes are too smart (in the wrong way)
Therefore smart, stateful middleboxes hide the inadequacies of application design paradigms
Therefore applications aren't alive.
